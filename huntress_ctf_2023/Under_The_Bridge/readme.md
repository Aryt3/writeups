# Under The Bridge

This is an OSINT challenge which is basically a GEOgeusser task. <br/>
To get the actual location we need to search for the most distinctive features. <br/>
So I just took a screenshot of the biggest building. <br/>

After taking it to google image search I was able to find this website: <br/>
https://www.movehut.co.uk/property/517521-151-freston-road-notting-dale-london-w10-6th/.

Like this we foudn the exact address of the building: `151, Freston Road, Notting Dale, London W10 6TH, W10 6TH`. <br/>

In google maps I inputed the address and got the exact location: <br/>

After inputing the location I was able to obtain the flag: `flag{fdc8cd4cff2c19e0d1022e78481ddf36}`.
