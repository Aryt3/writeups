## Writeup

Starting off we visit the github page.

After taking a look around like the issue I wasn't able to find anything of interest.

Going back to the main page of the `The-Lobby` repository I saw some characters which were looking somewhat off. <br/>
An example would be the first word ``OcτoHigh`. Taking another look I was able to see that the `t` wasn't an actual english letter. <br/>

Seeing multiple occurances I put all of those characters together to `τʜêʜᎥժժěɴϜᏞɑɢᎥᏚᎻėᚱě`. <br/>
Taking a look at the challenge description again I saw that they added `Flag is lowercase now!`. <br/>
Putting al of this together we obtain the flag `EKO{thehiddenflagishere}`
