• Response 2: PROTOCOL://<FQDN or IP>:PORT
```

```sh
echo -n 'responsel:response2' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'
```

`md5`

## Writeup

Starting off we do some static analysis. <br/>
```sh
kali@kali strings maleware.apk
--------------------------------
http://185.165.30.10:7878
--------------------------------
```
It appears that we found a possible answer to question 2. <br/>

The next thing I would do to get the name of the malware is uploading it do VirusTotal. <br/>

We can clearly see that the popular threat label is `RedAlert` so with an answer for both questions we can try to execute the command above with those variables. <br/>
```sh
kali@kali echo -n 'RedAlert:http://185.165.30.10:7878' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | md5sum | awk '{print $1}'
45be3ea00694896e0d70c8680a693ee5
```

Afterwards we get this String which happens to be our flag `45be3ea00694896e0d70c8680a693ee5`.
