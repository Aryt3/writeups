# Valentines Day

## Description
```
Happy Valentine's Day! I'm unfortunately spending my Valentine's Day working on my CS131 homework. 
I'm getting bored so I wrote something for my professor. 
To keep it secret, I encrypted it with a Vigenere cipher with a really long key (161 characters long!)

As a hint, I gave you the first part of the message I encrypted. 
Surely, you still can't figure it out though?

Flag format is lactf{xxx} with only lower case letters, numbers, and underscores between the braces.

Now this was pretty straight forward. We had the first line of the `ciphertext` in `plaintext`. <br/>
Having these 2 sentences in a `Vigen√®re Cipher` I generated the `key` in a python script. <br/>
```py
ciphertext = "Br olzy Jnyetbdrc'g xun, V avrkkr gb sssp km frja sbv kvflsffoi Jnuc Sathrg. Wkmk gytjzyakz mj jsqvcmtoh rc bkd. Canjc kns puadlctus!"
known_plaintext = "On this Valentine's day, I wanted to show my love for professor Paul Eggert. This challenge is dedicated to him. Enjoy the challenge!"

key = ''
for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
    if ciphertext[i].isalpha():
        diff = (ord(ciphertext[i]) - ord(known_plaintext[i])) % 26
        key += chr(diff + 65) if known_plaintext[i].isupper() else chr(diff + 97)

print(key)
```

Executing this script reveals the key to us. <br/>
```sh
kali@kali python3 solve.py
NevergOnnagiveyouupNevergonnaletyoudownnevergonnarUnarOundanDdesertyounevergonnamakeyoucrYnevergonnasaygoo
```

Looking up the rest of the lyrics I created the `161` character long `key`. <br/>
```

On this Valentine's day, I wanted to show my love for professor Paul Eggert. This challenge is dedicated to him. Enjoy the challenge!

I was sitting in the hot, steamy room of Fdduo 1178 luvlvlhvw tafrjbh nzrh and every exam problem, then searching through my slide print-outs for the closest match and then just writing it down and hoping for the best, when all of a sudden I stumnols djsu jya asgoywpb: "xjr qing banned in China?"

I remembered the wise words that my TA once told me:

Bing was never banned in China. Naive undergrad. Rent a virtual machine and check.

That's when I realilhk, iqy ieqd skq c pjgu omu zaong. And I had managed to crack the code. I had to rent a lnxsrv and check. Under my breath, I muttered the words export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH, and then the following:

cat ~eggqua/urhesuowwypobssyfh.smt | less
lactf{known_plaintext_and_were_off_to_the_races}

Suddenly, chilling wind brushed over my back.

After one and a half hours, they had finally managed to turn on the AC in fkl anwxbhv dkjn.

E hovhjxthly read through the answer key, slowly copying down the right answers onto my long, thick answer sheet when I hear Eggert scream C-s Student Who Is Cheating Off The Answer Whf xw bmz drpstg arodg uxmvue. I was in total shock. Shivering, I looked down at the front of the classroom, and watched as Eggert slowly turned his head until it locked onto me. "I will pkill you," he echoep. L dpb zvvpvj kr ou isty bwc rould only watch as he summoned his stand [BIRTHPLACE OF THE INTERNET].

I boelted from my seat, jumping over several unlucky students' desks and sprinting up the stairs and axa do Zvhdq exrq pms Dcvas df Sciences. But I could sense that Eggert was close on my tail. He summoned a dozen copies of himself with calls to pthread_create(), and they proceeded to chase me as I ran towmukh cbi tqkdcak xzwmrjwf. X hastily grabbed the door to enter mathsci, when one of the Eggert threads shouted "chmod a-x MATHSCI DOOR." I tried opening the door, but it shouted at me: "Permission denied." I edps "ag -j kefn" klf nfb jbux swe mathsci building.

I ran desperately from the Eggert clones, but soon found myself out of breath, because I'm a CS major and I sit at my desk all day. Suddenly, I saw one of Eggedw'z ruirli iqx bqss his ijkaway. I quickly opened the door next to me and stepped inside, breathing a sigh of relief. But then I turned myself around and screamed.

"Welcome to my office." Eggert echoed. "Yog'yl bjxi pj jk pyt. E hoo hfuk ihat you have a good grasp of the fundamentals of commonly-used software tools and environments, particularly open-source tools likely to be used in upper-division combxata mgpueyo aqqwgfg."

J fgxmpered and backed into the corner of his office.

"You may be wondering how you got here. I created a symbolic link between mathsci 6229 and my office here in Engineering VI. I wanf bvj ci ouen pryv E bco'h idqi you. I was merely testing you."

I gulped and looked into his eyes. "Really?"

"Yes..." Eggert replied, "In fact, I brought you here into my office to ask you one very important question."

"Wtda?" X bnyajvnob.

Gclssh mnzced back in his chair, smiling. "You see, for the past several years I have been building up a team of highly capable individuals, ones that can anticipate foreign cybersecudlan cbvlqko ppqi uzbqfb rjch as USC and stop them. I use the class CS35L in order to sort through all of UCLA's undergraduate CS students, and find the ones with the potential to join this league of cybed klgxyw."

"Axrp'c... Rjwy'g jaqxrhible..." I said.

"You probably haven't realized it yet," Eggert explained, "but while running away from me you were able to utilize a multitude of linux commands in order to escapq pf lauxo. Tf uys wjissgujms what that means?"

"Uh...." I said, realizing it was quite strange I was able to verbally incantate gnu coreutils, "y-yeah, I guess...?"

Eggert gazed so deeply into my soul I felt as if he hap ubc cbi jediklf ptd pb nh hcternal organs. "Join me, and together we will curve down the world."
