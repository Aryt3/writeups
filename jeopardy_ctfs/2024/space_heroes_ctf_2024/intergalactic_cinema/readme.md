# Intergalactic Cinema

## Description
```
I was partaking in a fun viewing of some show/movie with my alien bros but couldn't understand anything due to the alien voice dubbing present in the movie.

I've managed to download a script of what was said during the viewing but it seems to be encrypted, can you help me decrypt it?

## Writeup

Looking at the website we can see some encrypted text and some `letter/number mapping`. <br/>
These clues should indicate that it is most likely a `substitution cipher`. <br/>
Copying the `ciphertext` into an [online-solver](https://planetcalc.com/8047/) returns some plaintext although it isn't able to map everything correctly. <br/>
```py
# frqdq wdq 87 s2mr fr38zs ws zr7sfs, bwbq.
# there are no such things as ghosts, babe.
```
Mapping some letters we can make our own script to decrypt the whole thing. <br/>
```py
known_chars = {
    'f': 't',
    'r': 'h',
    'q': 'e',
    'd': 'r',
    'w': 'a',
    '8': 'n',
    '7': 'o',
    's': 's',
    '2': 'u',
    'm': 'c',
    'r': 'h',
    '3': 'i',
    'z': 'g',
    'b': 'b',
}

# frqdq wdq 87 s2mr fr38zs ws zr7sfs, bwbq.
# there are no such things as ghosts, babe.

with open('ct.txt', 'r') as file:
    out = ''
    for line in file:
        for char in line:
            if char in known_chars.keys():
                out += known_chars[char]
            elif char == ' ':
                out += ' '
            elif char in ['!', ',', ':', '.', "'", '"', '#', '?', '-', '_', '{', '}']:
                out += char
            elif char == '\n':
                out += '\n'
            else:
                out += '$'

print(out)
```

Executing the script, we can see that we can add some letters because single letters are missing in obvious words. <br/>
```
### line $$$$ ###
in a strange galaxy.

### line $$$$ ###
$aybe right no$

### line $$$$ ###
she's settling in $or the long na$...
```

Mapping all correct letters reveals the flag. <br/>
The numbers can be mapped via the lines `### line $$$$ ###` (starts off with 1). <br/>
```py
known_chars = {
    'f': 't',
    'r': 'h',
    'q': 'e',
    'd': 'r',
    'w': 'a',
    '8': 'n',
    '7': 'o',
    's': 's',
    '2': 'u',
    'm': 'c',
    'r': 'h',
    '3': 'i',
    'z': 'g',
    'b': 'b',
    '6': 'l',
    'o': 'x',
    '1': 'y',
    'y': 'f',
    'v': 'm',
    'i': 'w',
    'k': 't',
    '9': 'l',
    'a': 'd',
    '4': 'p',
    'c': '1',
    'p': '2',
    'g': '3',
    'h': '4',
    't': '5',
    '0': '6',
    '5': '7',
    'n': '8',
    'l': '9',
    'x': '0',
    'e': 'z',
    'j': 'q',
}

# frqdq wdq 87 s2mr fr38zs ws zr7sfs, bwbq.
# there are no such things as ghosts, babe.

with open('ct.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        line_out = ''
        for char in line:
            if char in known_chars.keys():
                line_out += known_chars[char]
            elif char == ' ':
                line_out += ' '
            elif char in ['!', ',', ':', '.', "'", '"', '#', '?', '-', '_', '{', '}']:
                line_out += char
            elif char == '\n':
                line_out += '\n'
            else:
                line_out += '$'

        if line_out.startswith('shctf{'):
            print(line_out)
```

Executing the script reveals the flag which concludes this writeup. <br/>
```sh
$ python3 solver.py
shctf{d0_n0t_g0_g3ntle_into_that_g0od_n1ght}
```
