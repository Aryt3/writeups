## Writeup

Looking at the provided `.gif` file it looked as if a QR-Code was split into multiple smaller pictures and put into a single `.gif` animation.

I proceeded to use an online tool to get each frame and download them as seperate pictures. (https://extractgif.imageonline.co/)<br/>

I then put them together in a whiteboard and obtained 3 different QR-Codes. <br/>

This QR-Code had the output `QR_code5_h4ve_ev0lved_1nto_us3ful_tools for_`.

This QR-Code had the output `grodno{In_t0day's_dig1tal_4ge,_`.

Putting them together I obtained `grodno{In_t0day's_dig1tal_4ge,_QR_code5_h4ve_ev0lved_1nto_us3ful_tools for_pe0ple,_compan13s,_and_organ1zat10ns}` which concludes this writeup.
