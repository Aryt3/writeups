Taking a look at the provided Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugzma5lx910) we see, that a Justin Bieber Fan is saying some italian words and crying. <br/>
Seeing the video I took some screenshots of the fan and did a google image search which gave me the following articles. <br/>

One of the articles mentioned the following:
```
On October 9, 2014, Fanpage.it published a journalistic report dedicated to groups of teenagers stationed in front of the entrances of the hotels of the Lungomare in Naples in a desperate attempt to meet Justin Bieber.
```

From there I did another google search which lead me to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoaF7v-DYg8. <br/> 
In this youtube video I found the following image. <br/>

From this image I got the flag `hctf{Grand_Hotel_Vesuvio}` which concluded this challenge.
