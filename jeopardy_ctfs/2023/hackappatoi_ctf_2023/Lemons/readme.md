## Writeup

Starting off I took a look at the website but found nothing of interest. <br/>
Before starting an activate scan on the website I visited `/robots.txt` and found some interesting stuff. <br/>
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /flag

User-agent: AdsBot-Google
Disallow: /signora
```

`/flag` was a rickroll but `/signora` was where I found the actual flag. <br/>

This concludes the first web challenge.
